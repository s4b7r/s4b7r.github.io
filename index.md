Hi, my name is Simon. I am a computer scientist and engineer, working in-between computational science and computational engineering with a focus on machine learning, optimization and simulations.
I am part of Christian Schr√∂der's Computational Materials Science and Engineering group at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.

I do research in machine learning to simulate and optimize applications in physics and engineering. My interest is also in building diverse software stacks and workflows to solve all kinds of problems.

I like to exchange and collaborate with others - in the best case to gain new knowledge or give my knowledge and support to others. That's why you can also find me giving lectures in high performance computing and computer science basics. 

Besides my "working life" I like to tinker with other software (for example Jekyll, which is responsible for this site) or get my hands dirty on hardware, if there is some spare time. I also collaborate with others to make and do exciting things. I co-founded [Studienfonds Community](https://studienfondscommunity.de/), the association of Deutschlandstipendium scholars in Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Germany, and help to understand the [soil moisture level in the Teutoburg Forest](https://codefor.de/blog/feuchtigkeit-teutoburger-wald/) in a citizen science project.
