Hi, my name is Simon. I am a computer scientist and engineer, working in-between computational science and computational engineering with a focus on machine learning, optimization and simulations.
I am part of Christian Schr√∂der's Computational Materials Science and Engineering group at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.

I do research in machine learning to simulate and optimize phenomena and applications from physics and engineering. You can also find me giving lectures in high performance computing and computer science basics.

Besides my "working life" I like to tinker with other software (for example Jekyll, which is resposible for this site) or get my hands dirty on hardware. I also collaborate with others to make and do exciting things. I co-founded Studienfonds Community, the association of Deutschlandstipendium scholars in Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Germany, and help to understand the soil moisture level in the Teutoburg Forest in a citizen science project.
